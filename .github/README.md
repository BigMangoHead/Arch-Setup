A git repository containing my arch setup for backup and installation purposes.
The main branch is *intended* to not contain too many computer-specific changes, while the other branches are computer-specific.

This uses a git bare repository to track my home directory.
For an explanation of how this works, check out this article: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles

I also have some useful scripts and files from other locations in /arch-setup/
